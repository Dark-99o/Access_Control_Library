# Access Control Library

## Project Description

The Access Control Library is a comprehensive, reusable smart contract library built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. This library provides robust role-based access control patterns that can be integrated into any Stacks smart contract to manage permissions, user roles, and authorization workflows.

The library implements a hierarchical role system with three main roles: Admin, Moderator, and User, each with different permission levels and capabilities. It offers secure, gas-efficient functions for granting roles and checking user permissions, making it an essential building block for decentralized applications requiring sophisticated access management.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create the go-to access control solution for the Stacks ecosystem, providing developers with battle-tested, secure, and flexible role management tools. We aim to:

- **Standardize Access Control**: Establish consistent patterns for role-based permissions across Stacks DApps
- **Enhance Security**: Provide thoroughly audited and secure access control mechanisms
- **Improve Developer Experience**: Offer easy-to-integrate, well-documented libraries that save development time
- **Foster Innovation**: Enable complex DApp architectures by providing reliable foundational components
- **Build Community Trust**: Create transparent, open-source tools that promote best practices in blockchain development

By making access control simple and secure, we enable developers to focus on building innovative features rather than reinventing security wheels.

## Future Scope

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements
- **Dynamic Role Creation**: Allow contracts to create custom roles beyond the default three
- **Time-Based Permissions**: Implement temporary roles with automatic expiration
- **Multi-Signature Role Management**: Require multiple approvals for sensitive role changes
- **Role Transfer Mechanisms**: Enable secure role transfers between principals

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- **Delegation Patterns**: Allow role holders to temporarily delegate permissions
- **Permission Inheritance**: Create complex role hierarchies with inheritance
- **Audit Trail Integration**: Comprehensive logging of all access control events
- **Cross-Contract Role Recognition**: Enable roles to work across multiple contracts

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration
- **Frontend SDK**: JavaScript/TypeScript library for easy frontend integration
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing tools for access control scenarios
- **Governance Integration**: Connect with DAO frameworks for decentralized role management
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring and analytics for role usage

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features
- **Compliance Modules**: Built-in compliance features for regulated industries
- **Enterprise Connectors**: Integration with traditional enterprise identity systems
- **Scalability Optimizations**: Advanced patterns for high-volume applications
- **Professional Support**: Dedicated support channels for enterprise users

## Key Features

### üîê **Role-Based Access Control**
- Three-tier role system (Admin, Moderator, User)
- Hierarchical permission structure
- Granular access control

### ‚ö° **Gas-Efficient Operations**
- Optimized map structures
- Minimal storage overhead
- Efficient permission checks

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security-First Design**
- Comprehensive error handling
- Protection against common vulnerabilities
- Audit-ready code structure

### üîß **Developer-Friendly**
- Clear function interfaces
- Comprehensive documentation
- Easy integration patterns

## Main Functions

### `grant-role(user, role)`
Grants a specified role to a user principal. Only authorized users (admins for any role, moderators for user role) can grant roles.

### `has-role(user, role)`
Checks if a user has a specific role and returns detailed information including grant timestamp and granting principal.

---

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the contract to Stacks blockchain
2. The deploying address automatically receives admin role
3. Use `grant-role` to assign roles to other users
4. Use `has-role` to check permissions in your application logic
